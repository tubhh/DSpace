This is the prototype built by Hamburg University of Technology in context of the Hamburg Open Science program (HOS).

It's based on DSpace CRIS (Check the Wiki: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACECRIS/DSpace-CRIS+Home).

You can set it up like a normal DSpace system. Compared to generic DSpace CRIS it contains some customizations in the code. There are also some additional metadataformat schemas and the entity configuration has been modified.
See file TOR-README for further instructions (in german).
