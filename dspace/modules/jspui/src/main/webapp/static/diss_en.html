<h3>Notes about publication of theses</h3>
<p class="smaller">
If you want to publish your doctoral thesis on TUBdok, please note the following.
<ul>
<li><b>Publishing for duty</b><br/>
<div class="smaller">If you wrote your thesis under the conditions of the new promotion regulations from 2006, you have the opportunity to carry out your publication duty by publishing on TUBdok. In this case you have to bring four printed issues for reference to the university library.</div>
</li>
<li><b>Publishing voluntarily</b><br/>
<div class="smaller">
If your thesis has been or will be published by a publishing company, you have to bring three printed issues to carry out your publication duty. Publishing on TUBdok is otional in this case.
Please talk to your publisher or look into your publishing contract to find out, if you are allowed to publish also on TUBdok.
Also you have the option to publish your thesis retroactively at any time (e.g. if the thesis has been published according to the promotion regulations before 2006), if you are legally allowed to do that.
</div>
<li><b>No copy restrictions and other DRM</b><br/>
<div class="smaller">Particularly if you are publishing to carry out your publication duty with TUBdok, the document must not be copy restricted or access restricted in another way. This is a requirement by the German National Library to ensure long term archivation of the document. If you dont want to waive copy restrictions, please do not publish your document as a doctoral thesis. In this case the publication duty cannot be carried out with TUBdok!</div>
</li>
<li><b>Putting the URN into the fulltext</b><br/>
<div class="smaller">After finishing filling out the form for metadata of your document you get an URN, which is used to identify your document in the net and makes it citable. You can put this URN into your documents fulltext. If you want to do that, please do not submit any file at the end of publication process! You can send us the file later (after you inserted the URN) by eMail. It's optional to do that, but it helps to identify printouts of your document.</div>
</li>
</ul>
